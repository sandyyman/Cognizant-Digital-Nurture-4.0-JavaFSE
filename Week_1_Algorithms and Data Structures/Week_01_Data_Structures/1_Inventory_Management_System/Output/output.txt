Why are data structures and algorithms essential?
In a large inventory system, we may need to:
Store and retrieve thousands of products.
Frequently update quantities or prices.
Search for products quickly by ID.

Data Structures help us:
  Store data efficiently.
  Access, update, or remove data in optimal time.

Algorithms ensure:
  Operations like searching and sorting are fast and accurate.
  We use minimal memory and CPU cycles.

Suitable Data Strucutes
  ArrayList:For ordered data access, but TC:O(n)
  HashMap:For faster access TC:O(n)
  TreeMap:Useful when sorted order is required TC:O(nlogn)

Operation	Time Complexity (Average)	Explanation

addProduct()	O(1)	HashMap inserts in constant time.
updateProduct()	O(1)	Direct lookup by productId.
deleteProduct()	O(1)	Direct deletion by key.
viewInventory()	O(n)	Must traverse all products.


Optimizations
We can use LinkedHashMap for faster retrieval
Also we can use Database for faster and smooth access of the data.
