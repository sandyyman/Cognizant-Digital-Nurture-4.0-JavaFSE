| Algorithm   | Best Case  | Average Case | Worst Case |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Bubble Sort | O(n)       | O(n²)        | O(n²)      |
| Quick Sort  | O(n log n) | O(n log n)   | O(n²)      |

Bubble Sort is simple but inefficient for large datasets.

Quick Sort is much faster on average and suitable for large-scale applications.

Quick Sort is generally preferred due to its divide-and-conquer strategy and in-place sorting.
