Big O Notation
Big O Notation describes the upper bound of an algorithmâ€™s time or space complexity in terms of input size n. It helps us understand how an algorithm's performance scales.

Notation	Meaning	Example
O(1)	    Constant Time	Hash lookup
O(log n)	Logarithmic Time	Binary search
O(n)	    Linear Time	Linear search

Suitability for E-Commerce:
Linear Search is simple and works on unsorted data.

Binary Search is significantly faster on large, sorted datasets.

For real world we can use HashMap, TreeMap.
